# httprobe

Take a list of domains and probe for working http and https servers.

## Install

```
▶ go install github.com/florianwagnerdotme/httprobe@latest
```

## Basic Usage

httprobe accepts line-delimited domains on `stdin`:

```
▶ cat recon/example/domains.txt
example.com
example.edu
example.net
▶ cat recon/example/domains.txt | httprobe
http://example.com
http://example.net
http://example.edu
https://example.com
https://example.edu
https://example.net
```

## Extra Probes

By default httprobe checks for HTTP on port 80 and HTTPS on port 443. You can add additional
probes with the `-p` flag by specifying a protocol and port pair.
Additionally there is the option to use either predefined lists of ports by specifing `-p large` or `-p xlarge`
or to define a custom port list within the code itself. Use this custom port list by giving the argument `-p customPorts`.
Search in main for "customPorts" to find the position to specify your own set of custom ports.

```
▶ cat domains.txt | httprobe -p http:81 -p https:8443
▶ cat domains.txt | httprobe -p large
▶ cat domains.txt | httprobe -p xlarge
▶ cat domains.txt | httprobe -p customPorts
```

## Concurrency

You can set the concurrency level with the `-c` flag:

```
▶ cat domains.txt | httprobe -c 50
```

## Timeout

You can change the timeout by using the `-t` flag and specifying a timeout in milliseconds:

```
▶ cat domains.txt | httprobe -t 20000
```

## Skipping Default Probes

If you don't want to probe for HTTP on port 80 or HTTPS on port 443, you can use the
`-s` flag. You'll need to specify the probes you do want using the `-p` flag:

```
▶ cat domains.txt | httprobe -s -p https:8443
```

## Prefer HTTPS

Sometimes you don't care about checking HTTP if HTTPS is working. You can do that with the `--prefer-https` flag:

```
▶ cat domains.txt | httprobe --prefer-https
```

## Docker

Build the docker container:

```
▶ docker build -t httprobe .
```

Run the container, passing the contents of a file into stdin of the process inside the container. `-i` is required to correctly map `stdin` into the container and to the `httprobe` binary.

```
▶ cat domains.txt | docker run -i httprobe <args>
```
